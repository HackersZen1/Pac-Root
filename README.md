**Privilege escalation** is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw or configuration oversight in an operating system, or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. The result is that an application with more privileges than intended by the application developer or system administrator can perform unauthorized actions.
